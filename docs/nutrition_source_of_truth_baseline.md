# Nutrition Source of Truth — Baseline (Foundational Health)

**Source:** *Optimal Cycling Nutrition* — Dr Emma Wilkins & Tom Bell (2023), Ch. 1–3
**Reference PDF:** `docs/references/Optimal_Cycling_Nutrition.pdf`
**Purpose:** Defines the foundational dietary layer that must be in place *before* training-specific nutrition (see `nutrition_source_of_truth_training.md`) can be optimised. This is the "bottom of the pyramid" — without this layer, sport-specific manipulation of macros has limited effect.

**Owner/Process:** Engineering + Athlete — stable reference, update only if foundational guidelines change.

## 1. The Nutrition Pyramid

```
      [ Supplements ]         ← marginal gains only when base is solid
   [ Sport-Specific Nutrition ]  ← timing, periodisation, RCA (training doc)
 [ Balanced Foundational Diet ]  ← THIS DOCUMENT
```

> "Unless you have a well-developed aerobic base, working on top-end abilities won't get you to a high level. Similarly, unless you have a good nutritional foundation... optimising sports nutrition practices won't get very far either."
> *(Ch. 3 — Fundamentals for Health)*

## 2. Foundational Daily Targets

### 2.1 Food Group Minimums

| Category | Daily Target | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Fruits & vegetables | ≥5 portions (≥400 g) | Wide variety; different colours across the day |
| Whole grain carbohydrates | Every main meal | Oats, brown rice, wholegrain bread/pasta, quinoa |
| Protein servings | 3–5 servings/day | 15–25 g per serving; vary sources for amino acid spectrum |
| Calcium-rich foods | 2–4 servings/day | Dairy or calcium-fortified plant alternatives |
| Fluids | ≥1.2 L/day baseline | Plus additional fluids during and after exercise |

### 2.2 Macronutrient Baseline (non-cycling general population)

| Macronutrient | General Baseline | Cyclist Adjustment |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Carbohydrates | ~45–65% of kcal | Higher; periodised by training day (see training doc) |
| Protein | 0.8 g/kg/day (general) | 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day for cyclists |
| Fat | 20–35% of kcal | Hold 20–25%; prioritise unsaturated |
| Saturated fat | Minimise | ≤20 g/day women, ≤30 g/day men |

## 3. Macronutrient Roles (Reference)

### 3.1 Carbohydrates

**Role:** Primary fuel for brain, CNS, and muscles at all intensities. Stored as blood glucose and glycogen (liver + muscles). Cyclists store ~1,500–2,500 kcal of glycogen — enough for 1.5–2H of race-pace effort.

**Key principle — fat burns in a carbohydrate flame:** Fat oxidation requires at least some carbohydrate; you cannot rely on fat alone.

**GI guidance for baseline diet:**
- Prefer **low-GI** carbs at baseline: oats, wholegrain pasta/rice/bread, beans, lentils, most fruits, vegetables
- Reserve **high-GI** carbs for around training sessions (see training doc §6)
- Cooked-then-cooled starches (cold pasta, potato salad, cold rice) develop resistant starch → effectively lower GI

### 3.2 Protein

**Role:** Not a primary fuel. Provides amino acids for muscle synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, tissue repair, enzymes, and hormones.

**Meal distribution matters:** Maximum protein the body can use per meal for tissue synthesis: ~15–25 g (0.2–0.3 g/kg). Spread intake across 3–5 meals for best use.

**Complete proteins** (contain all 9 essential amino acids): meat, fish, eggs, dairy, soy products (tofu, tempeh, edamame, miso).
**Incomplete but combinable:** rice + beans, wholemeal toast + nut butter = full spectrum.

### 3.3 Fat

**Role:** Energy at low-moderate intensity, hormone synthesis, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), cell membranes, omega-3/6.

**Type preference:**
- Prioritise: unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, seeds, oily fish, avocado)
- Limit saturated fats (fatty meat, full-fat dairy, coconut oil, cakes): ≤30 g/day men, ≤20 g/day women
- Omega-3 (DHA/EPA): oily fish 2×/week minimum; walnuts and linseed for plant sources

**Fat oxidation capacity:** Training status, caffeine, time of day (later = higher fat oxidation), and prior nutrition all influence ability to burn fat. A better fat oxidation capacity improves endurance and FTP.

## 4. Micronutrient Baseline Targets

### 4.1 Priority Micronutrients for Cyclists

| Nutrient | Target (Cyclists) | At-Risk Groups | Food Priority |
|----------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Iron** | ~70% above general RDA: men ~14.8 mg/day; pre-menopausal women ~25 mg/day | Vegetarians/vegans, menstruating women, low energy intake | Lean red meat, poultry, fish, spinach, lentils; pair with vitamin C |
| **Vitamin B12** | ≥1.5 mcg/day; cyclists slightly higher | Vegans (no natural plant sources), adults >50 | Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, fortified plant milks |
| **Calcium** | 700 mg/day (no athlete upward adjustment needed) | Vegans, lactose-intolerant, post-menopausal women | Dairy, leafy greens, tofu, fortified milk alternatives, sardines |
| **Vitamin D** | 10 mcg (400 IU)/day supplement recommended for Pacific NW athletes | Those with limited sun, darker skin tones, indoors workers | Oily fish, fortified foods; primarily from sun |
| **Zinc** | Men 9.5 mg/day; women 7.0 mg/day (vegetarians may need +50%) | Vegetarians/vegans, high-carb/low-animal-protein diets | Meat, seafood, whole grains, legumes, pumpkin seeds |

### 4.2 Practical Micronutrient Rules

1. **Iron absorption tip:** eat iron-rich foods alongside vitamin C (citrus, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli). Avoid tea/coffee within 1H of iron-rich meals (inhibits absorption).
2. **Vitamin D default:** Supplement 10 mcg/day especially Oct–Apr in Pacific Northwest. Do not exceed 100 mcg (4,000 IU).
3. **Vegan cyclists:** Supplement B12, consider iodine (nori 1.5–2 sheets/day or fortified milk), selenium (1–3 Brazil nuts/day max), and omega-3 (algae-based DHA/EPA).
4. **Blood testing:** Recommended every 6–12 months if symptomatic or at-risk. Test: CBC, haemoglobin, ferritin, iron, B12, Vitamin D.

## 5. Hydration Baseline

| Metric | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Daily baseline | ≥1.2 L from all fluids (water, tea, coffee, milk count) |
| Exercise (general) | Drink to thirst; urine should be pale yellow |
| Monitoring | Weigh pre/post workout: 1 kg weight loss ≈ ~1 L fluid deficit |
| Electrolytes | Needed for sessions >90 min or heavy sweat; sodium is key |
| Sports drinks | Useful for sessions >60–90 min at moderate-high intensity; adds carbs + electrolytes |
| Hyponatremia risk | Over-drinking plain water on long events; use electrolyte drinks |

## 6. Supplement Hierarchy

Supplements are the **top of the pyramid** — only beneficial when the layers below are solid.

### 6.1 Recommended for General Cyclist Health

| Supplement | Dose | Indication |
|------------|------|-----------|
| Vitamin D | 10 mcg (400 IU)/day | Limited sun (Oct–Apr in Pacific Northwest) |
| Vitamin B12 | Any standard dose (water-soluble, excess excreted) | Vegans |
| Iron (Floradix / Spatone) | Per product guidance | Confirmed deficiency, menstruating females at risk |

### 6.2 Evidence-Based Performance Supplements

*(Source: Ch. 9 — Supplements)*

| Supplement | Evidence | Practical Use |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Caffeine** | Strong | 3–6 mg/kg, 20–60 min pre-session; reduces perceived effort; improves power output |
| **Beetroot / Nitrate** | Moderate-strong | ~400–500 mg nitrate, 2–3H before effort; improves VO2max and time-trial performance |
| **Beta-Alanine** | Moderate | 3.2–6.4 g/day (split doses to avoid tingling); buffers fatigue at high intensities; 4–6 weeks to take effect |
| **Sodium Bicarbonate** | Moderate | 0.3 g/kg, 60–90 min before; buffering agent for high-intensity efforts |
| **Creatine** | Moderate (limited cycling evidence) | 3–5 g/day; more relevant for strength; may help sprint power in criteriums |
| **Tart Cherry Juice** | Moderate | 30 mL concentrate 2× daily; reduces muscle soreness; useful around stage races |
| **BCAAs** | Weak | Not recommended when protein intake is adequate |

### 6.3 Risk Reduction

- Always use supplements with a third-party quality certification (NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Sport)
- Never take two supplements that both contain the same micronutrient (e.g. multivitamin + cod liver oil can lead to vitamin D overdose)
- Consult a medical practitioner before starting any new supplement

## 9. Interaction with Training Source of Truth

This document defines the **floor**. The training document (`nutrition_source_of_truth_training.md`) defines how macros are **manipulated above that floor** based on training type and intensity.

Key interaction rules:
- Training-day carb periodisation operates within the framework of the balanced diet baseline (§2 of this doc)
- Protein targets from the training doc (1.2–2.0 g/kg) always exceed the general population baseline (0.8 g/kg) — the training doc takes precedence
- The energy floor from §6 of this doc (30 kcal/kg FFM) is a hard floor that the training doc cannot override, even during weight-loss phases
- GI strategy from §3.1 of this doc applies to baseline meals; training doc §6 applies to peri-workout nutrition
